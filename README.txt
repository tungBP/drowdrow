This is step by step to run the drowsiness detection project.
In the zip file include a python program name drowsiness_detect.py. Open the folder and the Python file in Visual Studio Code. There are multiple dependencies that need to be installed to run the python program.
The command that can be used to install all of the dependencies is:
pip install Flask opencv-python dlib numpy pygame imutils scipy
After installed all dependencies, run the program file and the code can be run locally with the support of flask. The terminal will show the ip address and it should take you to the drowsiness detection run on web browser.
There are start camera and stop camera button and there is a setting sections that can modify the landmarks and frame. 
If the eye drowsiness detection can not detect successfully, try to adjust the landmarks for eye   lower
If the yawning detection can not detect successfully, try to adjust the landmarks for yawning higher.
To make the response more faster or slower based on need, increase or decrease frame for each fatigue.
The setting user can turn off or on the audio
